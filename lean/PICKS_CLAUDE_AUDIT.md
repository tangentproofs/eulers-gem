# Claude audit — Pick formalization (2026-09-24)

**Verdict: FAIL for presenting as Pick's theorem.**

Auditor: Claude (via `claude -p`), standing policy: double-check before claiming proved results.
This file is the gate: no Results/README claim that classical Pick is proved until a later audit PASSes.

## Critical FAIL points (copy from audit)

1. **Do not ship non-compiling geometry with overclaiming docs.**
   A draft `EulersGem/PicksGeometry.lean` claimed four results in the module docstring while still mid-tactic / non-building. **Deleted** rather than committed red. Any future geometry file must be `lake build`-green before commit, and docstrings may only name proved theorems.

2. **Honesty pass was insufficient while identifiers/table still said "Pick".**
   Arithmetic Funkenbusch/triangulation glue must **not** sit in a proved/landed column labeled Pick until the *statement* mentions a lattice polygon + geometric measure/area.
   Prefer names like `funkenbusch_identity` / `triangulation_count_identity`; **drop `picks` from identifiers** for the arithmetic glue.
   **Done in this train:** renamed theorems + Results exports; README/site/ROADMAP reworded; ROADMAP Pick checkbox unchecked.

3. **`Picks.lean` docstring overclaims.**
   Phrases such as "hence Pick", "classical shape", and a tautological `edges_of_triangulation` with a combinatorial docstring (identity hypothesis restated as theorem) were misleading.
   **Done:** docstrings rewritten as count identities; tautology deleted; handshaking left as an *assumption* with an explicit Mathlib gap note.

4. **ROADMAP checked box for Pick.**
   `- [x] Pick's theorem Euler→Funkenbusch bookkeeping` overclaimed.
   **Done:** unchecked / reworded to classical Pick open; only count identities landed.

5. **Real geometric path requirements (still open).**
   For an auditor-acceptable classical Pick, need all of:
   - lattice polygon definitions;
   - area as Lebesgue/Haar measure **or** shoelace proved equal to measure;
   - primitive triangle volume `= 1/2` via **det ↔ Haar** (not merely `|det|/2` arithmetic on a named `def`);
   - triangulation **existence** OR an honest witness whose fields are **geometric** (not free `ℤ` counters);
   - planar Euler **proved** (not assumed);
   - handshaking **proved** (not assumed);
   - area additivity across the triangulation.

   **ASAP acceptable target (not yet claimed in Results as Pick):**
   - primitive triangle shoelace/`|det|=1` facts, honestly labeled;
   - Pick-shaped conclusion **given** a fully geometric `PrimitiveLatticeTriangulation` witness;
   - **no** overclaim that triangulation existence is proved.

## Current status after remediation

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Broken `PicksGeometry.lean` | Deleted (was red) |
| Theorem ids without `picks_*` for glue | `funkenbusch_identity`, `triangulation_count_identity` |
| Results exports | `results_funkenbusch_identity`, `results_triangulation_count_identity` |
| README / site / ROADMAP | Explicit **not Pick**; ROADMAP unchecked |
| Classical Pick in Results | **Not claimed** (gate) |
| Geometric substrate | Not yet green-committed; next incremental commits only |

## Candidate for a future PASS (do not promote until re-audited)

None yet in Results. When a candidate exists, paste the **exact theorem type**, file path, and `lake build Results` log excerpt below and re-run Claude before any claim commit.
